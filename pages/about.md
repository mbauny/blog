# About

Hello there!

My name is **Matthieu Bauny** and I am a :fr: **software engineer**.

I am a **C++ application developer** with an extensive knowledge of the Qt framework and a **keen eye for UX**.

My previous work experiences notably include the following positions:

-   C++/Lua tool developer at [Quantic Dream](http://www.quanticdream.com/) where I helped build the toolchain that powered [Detroit: Become human](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/detroit-become-human)
-   C++/JS developer at [Dassault Syst&egrave;mes](http://www.3ds.com/) where I got to work on [CATIA v6](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia) and the late 3DVIA Studio (i.e. [Virtools](https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/3d-engine-virtools) 2.0, a powerful game engine)

Everything else can be found on my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mbauny) profile.

My current computer-related interests resolve mostly around **procedural narrative and the Javascript ecosystem**. Other than that, I love a good story and will probably die of a music overdose.

The title of this blog is a nod to [Team Fortress 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgNBsCI4EA).
